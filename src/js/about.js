Originally, SpecDB was intended to be an AMD counterpart to Intel\'s ARK website, but today it contains part data from multiple manufacturers. Mark Polyakov, @markasoftware on GitHub, is the main SpecDB developer. @zcskywire2 is responsible for entering much of the AMD part data (yes, by hand). Other contributors include @Sam-Mear and @Benzhaomin. The data for SpecDB comes from a combination of manually-entered data, which you can find in the GitHub repository, and data automatically scraped and processed from third-party websites (such as Intel ARK, Userbenchmark, and Geekbench). You can find the scripts that perform this scraping on GitHub as well. SpecDB is a Free and Open Source project.'),
